The way it's played, you have the same rules as tic tac toe but you must win three boards
The first move you can choose a board to play in, and the position of your move means the next player must play in that board.
If you get three in a row in a board, you win that board, and is now unplayable. If you play a move that sends the next player to a finished board, they get to choose any board to play.
